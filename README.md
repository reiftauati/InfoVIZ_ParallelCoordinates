This project is built in Java and utilizes the derby DBMS.
The purpose of this project is to visualize large sets of data
in an elegant and informative way. 
Parallel coordinate displays are a standard INFOVIZ design solution 
for visualizing large amounts of data. 
This project maps something like 50000 runners in a marathon.
